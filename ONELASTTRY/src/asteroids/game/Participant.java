 * velocity. A Participant can be either "active" or "expired". An active
 * Participant is displayed on the screen and can interact with other
 * Participants. An expired Participant is not displayed on the screen, cannot
 * interact with other Participants, and will be removed automatically from the
 * game.
 * 
 * This is an abstract class, so it can be used only by creating a derived class
